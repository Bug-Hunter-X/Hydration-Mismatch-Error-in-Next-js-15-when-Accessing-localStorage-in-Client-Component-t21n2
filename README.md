# Next.js 15 Hydration Mismatch Bug

This repository demonstrates a hydration mismatch bug in a Next.js 15 application when accessing `localStorage` within a client component.  The error occurs specifically in production mode because of discrepancies between the server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side hydration stages. The server-side attempt to read `localStorage` results in `undefined`, while the client-side expects data.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run build` to build the application.
4. Run `npm run start` to start the production server.
5. Navigate to `/about`.

You should observe an error in your browser's console indicating a hydration mismatch.

## Solution

The solution involves conditionally rendering the component based on the availability of `localStorage` data on the client-side. This prevents the server-side from attempting to access `localStorage`.
